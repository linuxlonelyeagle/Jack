This repository is a learning experience for *The Elements Of Computing Systems*, to this day, this is still my favorite book, although I still forget a lot of what's inside. At the very beginning I did not intend to submit the code of this project to github repository (Honestly, since I didn't know anything about compilers at that point, I borrowed from other people's code as I was learning), the hardware part was missing, so only the software part of the implementation is included here. Updating the README is a year after I got involved in the open source project, and now I feel I'm much, much stronger, I have tried to do the front end, middle end and back end of the compiler.And my story with the compiler has begun.In this year, I understand what I really want to do. Finishing this book is the end of the book, but the beginning of my own path. I hope I can achieve more in the field of compilation and always do what I want to do.

I like the words of Shimon Schocken:The important thing is to be a mensch.To be human and to do the right thing.

Thank you!
